# Frontend Mentor - Social links profile solution

Hi! This is my solution to the [Social links profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). I tried to complete this challenge using only the references from the resources and my intuition to determine aspects like padding and border-radius.

## Overview

### Screenshot

This is an example of the component in a "desktop" resolution.

As you can see, the component looks good in mobile resolutions. In this example, the width resolution was set to 375px.

## My process

This time, I followed the Frontend Mentor suggestion to customize the social links with stuff related to me. Instead of using the images and info from the example, I used a photo of myself and some of my own information.

I am not an expert in designing components, but my process was the following:

1. I created the HTML elements as suggested by Frontend Mentor.
2. Then, I added the style.css sheet.
3. I like to work with variables, so I defined the main variables of my project where I put the colors in hex.
4. After that, I defined the "global aspect" of my project. As I like to work with rem, where 1rem = 10px, I set the font-size in the html to 62.5%.
5. Finally, I created the CSS for the component.

I considered using a "mobile first" approach, but since the component is simple, I decided to use some responsive aspects like relative widths (e.g., 90%, max-width, etc.) and the use of rem.

I re-used some code that I made from the QR challenge to make the process faster.
